-df_weather.iloc[:,21] increases show decreases in E price
-check corrs + diff corrs
-wind_direction in degree 0=east? 360=east, 180=west,
 90=north
-Lol, pressure has a high anti-correlation  with
 temperature :D  how unexpected :D :D :D
-pear['testfeature'] = temp_df.temperature * 
temp_df.rain_prob * temp_df.wind_speed 
* temp_df.wind_direction
is in top5 features of 1k tree RF; highest 
.feature_importance_ achieved

After first exploration: 
    -$generated, $d_price, $d_temperature largest feature
    importance, with and small overlap to correlations
    ($generated, $d_price, $d_pressure) to $price
    -pairplot confirms corrs, most vars poisson distributed
    -simple linear combinations yield features w/ only
     slighly improved corr to $price
    -idea: cluster states & weather for extra features?
    -try more combinations between linear combos between
     different vars of/in different states
