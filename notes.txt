-df_weather.iloc[:,21] increases show decreases in E price
-check corrs + diff corrs
-wind_direction in degree 0=east? 360=east, 180=west,
 90=north
-Lol, pressure has a high anti-correlation  with
 temperature :D  how unexpected :D :D :D
-pear['testfeature'] = temp_df.temperature * 
temp_df.rain_prob * temp_df.wind_speed 
* temp_df.wind_direction
is in top5 features of 1k tree RF; highest 
.feature_importance_ achieved

After first exploration: 
    -$generated, $d_price, $d_temperature largest feature
    importance, with and small overlap to correlations
    ($generated, $d_price, $d_pressure) to $price
    -pairplot confirms corrs, most vars poisson distributed
    -simple linear combinations yield features w/ only
     slighly improved corr to $price
    -idea: cluster states & weather for extra features?
    -try more combinations between linear combos between
     different vars of/in different states
    -add features on holidays (look for that old function)

After second day am-sesh:
    -including data from all states extemely interesting. 
    E.g. scheduledGeneration_QLD has highest corr to price_NSW - different states!!!
    -excluding np.nan there are still ~200rows, 60 correlations

    y.columns ['price_NSW', 'price_QLD', 'price_SA', 'price_VIC']

EOD:
    -RF power increases dramatically the closer to the end of dataset we get 
    -RF efficacy hovers around ~10% rel acc, even predicting for other states
    after training on NSW price movements
    -linear model (9 highest corr to price_NSW) yields dramatically better
    results in the single digits rel err
