y.columns ['price_NSW', 'price_QLD', 'price_SA', 'price_VIC']

-next steps:
    -do more EDA wrt the discoveries above, feature engineering, and
    more detailed everything.
    -do price/date encodings analysis!!!!!!!

-possibilities: 
    +study on whats different w/ scheduledGeneration_QLD/
    scheduledGeneration_NSW that they are so strong at explaining
    the data
    +hardcode the timeseries nature (shift +x steps)
    +create a dense, cnn+dense model with 5 outputs to
    +utilise timeseries nature w/ DNNs
    +wee HP tuning?
    +graph of results
    +dimensionalty reduction?
    +cluster?
    +branched architecture?
